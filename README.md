## MINDSCAN (MENTAL DISORDER PREDICTION) 

A mental disorder is a condition that affects a person's thinking, feeling, behavior, or mood, often causing distress or impairment.

Our project focuses on leveraging machine learning to create a predictive model for identifying and distinguishing between Bipolar Disorder Type 1, Bipolar Disorder Type 2, and Depression. By analyzing multifaceted data encompassing behavioral patterns, and environmental factors, our model aims to provide early detection and classification of these mental health conditions. 

This research holds promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, facilitating timely interventions, and ultimately improving patient care outcomes. 


## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Tailored Chatbot for Hostel Booking System is a project designed to integrate a chatbot that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries to the hostel booking system. Traditional hostel booking processes are often time-consuming and involve manual searches and extensive communication with hostel staff. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an easy-to-use chatbot interface that assists students in addressing inquiries.

## Results and Impact

In conclusion, this project represents a significant step forward in utilizing machine learning for mental health diagnosis, specifically targeting Bipolar Disorder Type 1, Bipolar Disorder Type 2, and Depression. By integrating predictive models within a user-friendly website interface, we aim to democratize access to early detection and intervention services. Leveraging insights from the literature review and  random forest algorithm, our platform promises improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment recommendations. With the potential to reduce stigma, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient outcomes, this project holds great promise for revolutionizing mental health care delivery in the digital age.
