    <p style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;font-size:20px;">A mental disorder, also referred to as a mental illness, encompasses a broad range of conditions that disrupt an individual's thinking, feeling, behavior, or mood. These disorders can vary significantly in severity, from mild to severe, and can have a profound impact on daily functioning and quality of life. Mental disorders can manifest in diverse ways, affecting cognition, emotions, perception, and behavior. They are often complex and multifaceted, arising from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychosocial factors. </p>
