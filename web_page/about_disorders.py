Engaging in pleasurable activities, setting achievable goals, and practicing self-compassion are essential components of self-care. Monitoring symptoms and seeking help promptly during relapses are crucial for long-term management. With persistence, support, and professional guidance, individuals can effectively overcome depression and regain a sense of well-being.</p>
